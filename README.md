Hello there! If you're wondering how to do this/do that then just read this FaQ and some others!

# FaQ

Q. Why key no work???
A. If the key has a green checkmark next to it, find the key with a green checkmark also. Make sure there are **no** spaces or extra letters when pasting in otherwise it will not work. If it doesn't work, try the other keys found in the key channel. If it still does not work, open a ticket and show a console log before and after entering the key.

Q. What is an executor???
A. ~~You are stupid~~ An executor allows you to run scripts (client-sided) and do (almost) everything you want! Some good and *free* executors are but not limited to: Krnl, Fluxus, Oxygen U, etc. Free executors require you to grab a key from a linkvertise and paste it in. However, if you are looking for a *premium* and *keyless* experience, you can try: Synapse X or Script-Ware. These are one time purchases and there is no monthly payments. (Synapse X ***SOON*** lol)

Q. Can I ping HannaeAltae#1147???
A. No.

Q. Where to download executors???
A. You can download Krnl from Krnl.place, Fluxus from fluxteam.net, Oxygen U from *either* wearedevs or from the other and official website oxygenu.xyz. For the *paid* executors, you can find Synapse X from x.synapse.to and Script-Ware from script-ware.com.

Q. Where are the scripts???
A. ~~Verify dumbass~~ After verifying, you are given access to the rest of the server. This includes the channel containing all the scripts and the channel containing the keys for some of the scripts.

Q. Where is the key???
A. ~~You're getting stabbed tonight~~ Above.

Q. What happens if I do commands outside the bot commands channel???
A. ~~You're gonna get stabbed by me~~ It will block you from using the command and tell you to go to the appropriate channel.

# Everything still doesn't work?

Make a ticket by going to the report issues channel. It will always be available to you verified or unverified. Note: Do not ping staff as they have a life outside of Discord (unlike you lol) so they may not have time to answer your question.
